QOR-Example create admin-panel for easy projects with authentification

Tiny example for create Admin-panel on Qor (github.com/qor/) for business application with users authentication, i18n and Sqlite base (see in publisher repositarium two example: 1- very light and no have Authentication; 2- very hard and use for storage Mysql - it's no good for alls little projects). Qor tries to keep to the MVC-principle of building applications. All Qor models based on Gorm (github.com/jinzhu/gorm, it's best ORM for Golang).

For compile runs this steps:
1) Install Qor and dependies from github.com/qor/
2) Run build.bat
- After running the script auto runs server on localhost:80
- Admin panel accesses from localhost:80/admin (test@test.com/testing)

For demonstration run:
1) download qoradmin_exe.zip, extract and run qoradmin.exe
- Server starts on localhost:80
- Admin panel accesses from localhost:80/admin (test@test.com/testing)
